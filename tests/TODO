What now:
- same mod time and size but middle of file different
- more double spaces fun
- "/" at beginning
- tests from 2.6.9
- expected error on chown
- games around long pathnames and long components thereof

flags to test:
- --max-size, --min-size
- --numerical-ids
- timeout

Bigger picture:
- run all tests that rsync to an empty directory also with a
  non-empty target directory (need to watch out for symlink
  malfunctions).

Longer term:
- fuzzing on filenames (will clash with what the filesystems can do)
- that whole hard link thing

Delicious tests:
================

--exclude '/foo/bar'
--exclude 'foo/bar'
--exclude 'foo*/*/bar'


Things that openrsync urgently needs for testing it:
====================================================

--no-whole-file

That flag forces rsync to use the checksum algorithm.  Without this
flag a simple test of making a new tree would never exercise that.

Implies implementing --whole-file while we are at it.

%%

-i --itemize-changes

This is a verbose printing option which tracks what exactly thingie is
doing.  This should be implemented early because it is tremendous help
in debugging.  It is also used by the original testsuite.

%%

-V --version needs to print the list of features we currently
support.  This is used by some tests to determine how rsync was
compiled, e.g. does it have atime support? This is trivial to do for
the more common features, it is just static printfs - as long as we
don't have conditional compilation in the first place.

%%%%

As for features that should be implemented soon, but not necessarily
for the test suite:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

-H --hard-links.  The lack of this hurts the ability to trust even
basic whole-tree copying, e.g. to move OS installations.

(A previous edition of this file said that -H is part of -a for GNU
rsync.  That was wrong, both GNU rsync and openrsync have the same
flags in -a, excluding -H)

macOS's rsync2 has a -E option (to copy extended attributes).  That
clashes with the original rsync2 which has a -E that preserves
executable status.

generally useful and easy to implement:
--prune-empty-dirs, -m   prune empty directory chains from file-list

%%

TODO:
- check whether apple rsync2 has the fixes for zlib corruption
- see whether --force solves the symlink problem
